    "# Location modules: Early findings\n",

    "\n",
    "In March I [taught a sensor](http://numenta.github.io/htmresearch/documents/location-layer/infer-2d-objects.html) how to infer locations and objects using this 3-layer approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/3-layers.svg\" style=\"width:600px; max-width: 90%;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, I use the same fundamental approach, but I implement the \"location layer\" differently. The layer uses principles of grid cells. It breaks the \"location SDR\" into a bunch of small modules. Each of these modules do path integration independently, and the population of cells represents a unique location.\n",
    "\n",
    "A location module is a group of cells that each fire at a different sensor location. You can visualize a location module by sorting the cells by their firing fields. Here are 25 cells mapped onto the locations where they fire. The activity of the 5 bold cells are shown as the sensor moves:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/5-cell-movement.svg\" style=\"width:600px; max-width: 90%;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "This chart assigns each cell an \"excitation\". This excitation might be a firing rate, a membrane potential, or some other continuous variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sensor goes past the edge of a location module, it wraps around to the other end. So the individual cells have grid-like firing fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/multiple-modules.svg\" style=\"width:300px; max-width: 90%;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "I built a \"location layer\" out of 18 location modules. Similar to grid cell modules, each module has a different scale and orientation -- i.e. the squares are sized and rotated differently. Together, the modules create novel location SDRs without having to learn any new path integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn't model a specific neural path integration mechanism. Instead, I simulate the result of path integration. I don't specify how cells do the computation: _\"Cell 3 is active\" + \"The sensor moves to the right\" => \"Cell 4 is active\"_. I just assume that it works, and I look at what we can do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some early findings."

    "The processed sensory input drives the location cells whenever path integration doesn't do the job. This always happens on the first sensation of an object, and it can happen after path integration errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the processed sensory input activates a location cell, the cell becomes active because it was active on previous occurrences of this sensory input. The layer essentially \"restores\" the cell activity of the previous occurrences. But there's a problem here: we can't restore the precise cell activity.\n",

During training and during testing, it never touches any other point.
