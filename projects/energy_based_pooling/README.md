# The HTM Spatial Pooler as a Hopfield network

 - **Brief overview** (probably still unfinished) of the approach: `latex/notes.pdf` 
 - First **experimental results** can be found in: `jupyter/results/...`. Each folder contains experimental results for a particular setup, briefly described in the associated readme file.
 -  The module also contains an implementation of the approach described in Földiák's paper. A re-run of "bars" experiment can be found here 
`jupyter/Foldiak\ --\ bars.ipynb`.
